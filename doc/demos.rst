Demo Exchange
-------------

There are three working parts to exchange demo:

* :ref:`demo-exchange-node` : scripts a demo tree with an exchange in a ROS node
* :ref:`demo-exchange-launch` : launches the demo tree/exchange node
* :ref:`demo-exchange-watcher` : tune into the exchange's services to watch the blackboards

.. _demo-exchange-node:

Node
^^^^

The node creates a simple sequence with two custom blackboard writers as children and attaches
an exchange to it.

Launcher
^^^^^^^^

.. _demo-exchange-watcher:

Watcher
^^^^^^^

Once launched, you can fire up :ref:`py-trees-blackboard-watcher` to list the variables and watch variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py-trees-blackboard-watcher --list-variables
    ....
    $ py-trees-blackboard-watcher gnocchi
    ....
